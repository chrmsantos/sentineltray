# SentinelTray

Release candidate: 3.0.0-rc.3 (06-02-2026)

Minimal Windows notifier that reads visible text from a target desktop app and sends an email when a phrase appears.

## Requirements

- Windows user session (no admin required).
- SMTP server access for email delivery.

## Setup

Edit config.local.yaml and set:

- monitors (list)
- monitors[].window_title_regex (a unique title prefix is enough)
- monitors[].phrase_regex (empty means any visible text; whitespace-only also means any visible text)
- use single quotes for regex to avoid YAML escape issues
- monitors[].email.smtp_host
- monitors[].email.from_address
- monitors[].email.to_addresses
- monitors[].email.subject
- monitors[].email.retry_attempts
- monitors[].email.retry_backoff_seconds
- monitors[].email.dry_run = true on first run; set false after validation
- monitors[].email.smtp_username (no config local)
- monitors[].email.smtp_password: leave empty; SentinelTray prompts on startup and stores it encrypted (DPAPI)
- allow_window_restore, send_repeated_matches
- log_only_mode
- log_level, log_console_level, log_console_enabled
- log_max_bytes, log_backup_count, log_run_files_keep
- min_repeat_seconds, error_notification_cooldown_seconds
- window_error_backoff_base_seconds, window_error_backoff_max_seconds
- window_error_circuit_threshold, window_error_circuit_seconds
- email_queue_file, email_queue_max_items, email_queue_max_age_seconds
- email_queue_max_attempts, email_queue_retry_base_seconds
- config_version (optional, default 1)

The application always reads the local config file at:

- config\config.local.yaml (inside the project folder)

If config.local.yaml is missing or invalid, the app opens the console error view with guidance.

SMTP passwords are stored using Windows DPAPI in:

- config\smtp_password_<index>.dpapi

## Run

scripts\run.cmd

When a venv is present, the launcher uses it automatically.

Manual venv activation from CMD:

scripts\activate_venv.cmd

If you run main.py directly, it automatically adds src/ to the import path.
SentinelTray starts in the foreground console interface. Use the menu to open Config,
trigger a manual scan, check matching windows, or Exit.

To keep the console menu stable, interactive mode suppresses console logging and
routes logs to the configured files only.

While running, SentinelTray prevents automatic sleep or display power-down to keep
the monitored window available for scans.

For a simple start, use the shortcut at the project root: Executar SentinelTray.cmd.

## Named executable (no admin)

To make the process clearly identifiable in Task Manager as SentinelTray.exe, build a named
executable locally (no admin privileges required):

scripts\build_named_exe.cmd

This creates dist\SentinelTray.exe. Launch it normally; in Task Manager it will appear as
SentinelTray.exe instead of python.exe/pythonw.exe.

## Config editing

Use the console menu Config option to edit settings directly in config.local.yaml.
The editor validates changes after closing.

## Regex (wildcards) and examples

Use regex in window title/name strings and in the text to look for. Tips:

- `.*` matches any sequence of characters.
- `.` matches a single character.
- `?` makes the previous character optional.
- `[A-Z]` matches a set/range.
- `\d` for digits, `\s` for spaces, `^` start and `$` end.

Examples:

- window_title_regex: 'Aplicacao.*Desktop'
- window_title_regex: '^App\\.Monitor\\..*'
- phrase_regex: 'PROTOCOLS?\\s+NOT\\s+RECEIVED'
- phrase_regex: 'ALERT|CRITICAL'

Notes:

- window_title_regex uses regex search (partial match by default). Use ^...$ if you need an exact match.

## Monitors (title + text + email)

Use `monitors` for all monitoring entries.
Each item must include its own email configuration.
Only the first monitor is used; additional entries are ignored.

Exemplo:

```yaml
monitors:
   - window_title_regex: 'APP1'
      phrase_regex: 'ALERT1'
      email:
         smtp_host: 'smtp.local'
         smtp_port: 587
         smtp_username: ''
         # Deixe vazio; a senha e solicitada no startup e salva via DPAPI.
         smtp_password: ''
         from_address: 'alerts1@example.com'
         to_addresses: ['ops1@example.com']
         use_tls: true
         timeout_seconds: 10
         subject: 'SentinelTray Notification'
         retry_attempts: 0
         retry_backoff_seconds: 0
         dry_run: true
   - window_title_regex: 'APP2'
      phrase_regex: 'ALERT2'
      email:
         smtp_host: 'smtp.local'
         smtp_port: 587
         smtp_username: ''
         # Deixe vazio; a senha e solicitada no startup e salva via DPAPI.
         smtp_password: ''
         from_address: 'alerts2@example.com'
         to_addresses: ['ops2@example.com']
         use_tls: true
         timeout_seconds: 10
         subject: 'SentinelTray Notification'
         retry_attempts: 0
         retry_backoff_seconds: 0
         dry_run: true
```

## Notes

- Logs are written per execution with detailed fields and kept with a max of 3 files in config\logs (values above 3 are capped).
- Logs rotate by size using log_max_bytes and log_backup_count.
- JSON logs are written alongside text logs in sentineltray.jsonl and per-run sentineltray_*.jsonl.
- If the config is missing or invalid, SentinelTray still starts in "Config Error" mode and exposes the error details in the console.
- When another instance is already running, the previous instance is terminated before startup (logged in sentineltray_boot.log).
- Third-party debug logs are suppressed to keep logs actionable.
- Logs and telemetry redact sensitive strings (emails and local paths) and store match summaries as hashes.
- state.json stores the last sent messages to avoid duplicates.
- Errors detected in each polling iteration are reported via email immediately.
- When the target window is unavailable or disabled, an alert is sent and the scan is skipped.
- Monitor failures use a per-monitor circuit breaker and local backoff to avoid alert storms.
- Email delivery failures are queued locally and retried with exponential backoff.
- Error notifications are rate-limited via error_notification_cooldown_seconds.
- Startup test and periodic healthchecks update status/logs but do not send email.
- When the target window is open, scans restore (if minimized), then ensure it is foreground and maximized before reading text.
- Phrase matching ignores accents, is case-insensitive, and matches partial text occurrences.
- Consecutive errors trigger exponential backoff before the next scan.
- Repeated messages are debounced by time window to avoid spam.
- Messages identical to the immediately previous scan are skipped.
- Messages with a lower leading number than the previous scan are skipped.
- send_repeated_matches still respects min_repeat_seconds if configured.
- Runtime artifacts are ignored by git via .gitignore.
- License: GPL-3.0-only.
- Logs include a structured category field.
- Local telemetry file captures last activity for quick diagnostics and lives in config\logs.
- Log-only mode skips normal alert sends but still emails error notifications.
- Email delivery failures are detected and reported as specific errors.
- Match alert emails use subject "SentinelTray Match Alert"; error alerts use "SentinelTray Error Alert".
- Info-category emails are suppressed; subjects like "SentinelTray Info" are never sent.
- Config validation rejects invalid intervals and paths at startup.
- Watchdog detects long scans and can reset components.
- Scans run only after 2+ minutes of user inactivity.
- Sensitive data is stored under config; operational logs stay in config\logs.
- Privacy policy in PRIVACY.md.
- Security policy in SECURITY.md.
- Licenses and third parties in docs/licenses.md.
- Releases include provenance (SLSA).
